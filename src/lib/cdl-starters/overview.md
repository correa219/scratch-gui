# Starter Files for caching

## Purpose
This folder is used to house the files that should be cached as our bases for projects.

## Origin
These files originally come as downloads from the scratch website.  To get them here we unzip them, and copy the contents over. THE ONE DIFFERENCE, is that they require (and have been given) an index file to designate each asset for caching by the gui application.
